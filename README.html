<p><a href="http://www.zeitnews.org" target="_blank">ZeitNews</a> is a science-oriented website dedicated to technology news. We operate as a branch of the <a href="http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/" target="_blank">Zeitgeist Movement</a>'s <a href="http://www.tzmtechteam.org" target="_blank">Technology Team</a> as an information hub which aims to inform as many people as possible about the current advancements and capabilities of science and technology. Technology is rapidly developing - faster than many of us realize - and with this website we aim to provide a clear picture of just how quickly this is happening through daily reporting of developments and breakthroughs around the world.</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>We are currently in the process of moving off Joomla! to Drupal. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/ZeitNews/main/issues">issue queue</a>.</p>


<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<ol>
<li>Please <a href="http://www.zeitnews.org/contact-us.html?view=rsform" target="_blank">drop us a line</a> to get in touch with the lead developer. We will provide some necessary files you may need to get started.</li>

<li>Review open issues on <a href="https://github.com/ZeitNews/main/issues">our issue queue</a> to see what work needs to be done.</li>

<li><a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/" target="_blank">Fork</a> the <a href="https://github.com/ZeitNews/main"><em>main</em> repo</a> and begin work in your local development environment.</li>

<p>Depending on what type of development you're working on, it may be beneficial to run an environment similar to what we use on the development and production servers. It would be good if you run not less-than or greater-than:<p>

<ul>
<li>Apache 2.2.x</li>
<li>MySQL 5.1.x</li>
<li>PHP 5.2.x</li>
<li>Varnish 2.x</li>
<li>Memcached 1.4.x</li>
<li>Pressflow Drupal 6.x</li>
<li>OpenPublish Drupal Distribution 2.3-build441</li>

<p>Our environment is pretty close to <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/pantheon/documentation" target="_blank">Pantheon's Project Mercury 1.1<a>, if you want to build a new environment from scratch.</p>

<li><a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/#initiating_the_pull_request" target="_blank">Submit a Pull Request</a> for review and inclusion.</li>
</ol>
