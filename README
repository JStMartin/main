___ABOUT___

ZeitNews is a science-oriented website dedicated to technology news. We
operate as a branch of the Zeitgeist Movement's Technology Team as an
information hub which aims to inform as many people as possible about the
current advancements and capabilities of science and technology. Technology is
rapidly developing - faster than many of us realize - and with this website we
aim to provide a clear picture of just how quickly this is happening through
daily reporting of developments and breakthroughs around the world.

We are currently in the process of moving off Joomla! to Drupal.


___GET INVOLVED___

1. Please drop us a line at http://www.zeitnews.org/contact-us.html?view=rsform
to get in touch with the lead developer. We will provide some necessary files
you may need to get started.

2. Review open issues on Github at https://github.com/ZeitNews/main/issues to
see what work needs to be done.

3. Fork the "main" repo on Github at https://github.com/ZeitNews/main and begin
work in your local development environment
(http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/).

Depending on what type of development you're working on, it may be beneficial
to run an environment similar to what we use on the development and production
servers. It would be good if you run not less-than or greater-than:
 - Apache 2.2.x
 - MySQL 5.1.x
 - PHP 5.2.x
 - Varnish 2.x
 - Memcached 1.4.x
 - Pressflow Drupal 6.x
 - OpenPublish Drupal Distribution 2.3-build441

Our environment is pretty close to Pantheon's Project Mercury 1.1
(http://groups.drupal.org/pantheon/documentation), if you want to build a new
environment from scratch.

4. Submit a Pull Request on Github for review and inclusion
(http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/#initiating_the_pull_request).


Thanks in advance,
