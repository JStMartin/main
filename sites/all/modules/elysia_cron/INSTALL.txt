INSTALLATION STEPS
-------------------

# STEP A. (Basic install)

After you enable elysia_cron module from drupal module administration, the new
cron system is already working. 
The only limitation in ending the install process here is that your cron calls 
will run no more than once an hour, because standard drupal installation follow
this behaviour.

So, if you want:
- to run some jobs more often than once an hour (eg: you have a function that
  should be executed every 5 minutes)
- to run a job at an exact time (eg:you must run a function at exactly "17:23")
  you must follow Step B

If you're not interested in running jobs very often, and you have no jobs that
needs an exact timing, you can skip Step B (and maybe also Step C, it's 
only an optional step)


# STEP B. (Change system crontab)

You must follow this step only if you need the requirements described in 
Step A.
So you should change the server crontab to launch drupal cron process each 
minute.

To do this refer to the section "Configuring cron jobs" of drupal documentation
(http://drupal.org/cron), the only difference is that the schedule rule must 
be "* * * * *".
Example:
* * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O - -q http://example.com/cron.php


IF YOU WANT TO ENABLE CRON KEY SECURITY...

... you should also add the choosen cron key (from elysia_cron setup) to the 
call.

Example:
* * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O - -q http://example.com/cron.php?cron_key=XYZ


IF YOU NEED TO EXECUTE A JOB VERY OFTEN OR NEED EXTRA PERFORMANCE...

... please look at "ADVANCED INSTALLATION" section below to see how to boost
performance of you drupal cron.


# (OPTIONAL) STEP C. (PERMISSIONS)
You can also give 'administer elysia_cron' permission to all user roles that 
needs to administer cron jobs. You can do this with standard drupal users 
administration.


# END

Nothing more.
By default elysia_cron will run all standard cron jobs sequentially (in a 
single channel) once an hour.
You can change this behavious with elysia_cron setup.

To access elysia_cron setup, and change the scheduling of your jobs or view
execution stats, go to page "admin/build/cron"


Note: to better see warnings on administration page you should consider adding 
a rule for "warn" class to theme CSS stylesheet, like this one:
.warn { color: red; font-weight: bold; }


ADVANCED INSTALLATION
----------------------

With the standard installation described above elysia cron will be launched
by standard drupal cron.
This add a little overhead to all cron calls (expecially for cache management
of variables, that is purged at each cron call).
You can usually ignore that, however if you want you can completely skip drupal
cron (and launch elysia_cron directly) by replacing file "cron.php" in the
root of drupal dir with the one in the elysia_cron package.
If you do so you must remember to not replace cron.php when upgrading drupal
core. 

To avoid the replacement of cron.php you can also call directly elysia cron's 
cron.php in crontab. 
Example:
* * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O - -q http://example.com/sites/all/modules/elysia_cron/cron.php

Note: This example works if you installed elysia_cron in "sites/all/modules" 
dir. If you installed elsewhere use that path instead.
